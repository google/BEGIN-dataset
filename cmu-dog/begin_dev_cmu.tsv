It also has the kind of spring - loaded allusive prankishness that, at times, will tickle adults even more than it does kids.'a work of genius. It got people to understand what toys are about. They're true to their own character. And that's just brilliant. It's got a shot that's always stuck with me, when Buzz Lightyear discovers he's a toy. He's sitting on this landing at the top of the staircase and the camera pulls back and he's this tiny little figure. He was this guy with a massive ego two seconds before... and it's stunning.

Nobody needs to be reminded that history tends to go in circles, but The Post is so vital because it captures the ecstasy of trying to break the chain and bend things towards justice ; defending the fundamental tenets of the Constitution hasn't been this much fun since Hamilton. has all the makings of an awards season hit, but is too calculated to reflect today's ragged, tenuous sociopolitical climate. Spielberg makes these crucial days in American history easy to follow. But if you look at The Post next to something like All the President's Men, you see the difference between having a story passively explained to you and actively helping to untangle it.

The point of Batman v Superman is n't fun , and it is n't thinking , either . It 's obedience . The theology is invoked ... to buttress a spectacle of power . And in that way the film serves as a metaphor for its own aspirations . The corporations that produce movies like this one , and the ambitious hacks who sign up to make them , have no evident motive beyond their own aggrandizement .   better than Man of Steel but below the high bar set by Nolan 's Dark Knight   As the film progresses , Lex degenerates into a gibbering mad man , some strange mix of the Riddler and the Joker with a little bit of Mark Zuckerberg added for flair . director : Zack Snyder genre : SuperHero introduction : Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice is a 2016 American superhero film featuring the DC Comics characters Batman and Superman .

They're true to their own character. And that's just brilliant. It's got a shot that's always stuck with me, when Buzz Lightyear discovers he's a toy. He's sitting on this landing at the top of the staircase and the camera pulls back and he's this tiny little figure. He was this guy with a massive ego two seconds before... and it's stunning.
