The authoritative version of this dataset is hosted on GitHub.

We encourage you to contact one of the authors by e-mail if you have
questions. <hrashkin@google.com> <reitter@google.com>

We very much welcome contributions that extend or improve this dataset.
There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License

to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.
