t5	tc	The Bible ( from Koine Greek  , t√† bibla, " the books " ) is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures that Jews and Christians consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans. With estimated total sales of over 5 billion copies, it is widely considered to be the most influential and best - selling book of all time. Many different authors contributed to the Bible. What is regarded as canonical text differs depending on traditions and groups ; a number of Bible canons have evolved, with overlapping and diverging contents. The Christian Old Testament overlaps with the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint ; the Hebrew Bible is known in Judaism as the Tanakh. The New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians, believed to be mostly Jewish disciples of Christ, written in first - century Koine Greek. These early Christian Greek writings consist of Gospels, letters, and apocalyptic writings. Among Christian denominations there is some disagreement about what should be included in the canon, primarily about the Apocrypha, a list of works that are regarded with varying levels of respect. prior to 1963 it was not uncommon for students in the US to be required to read from The Bible as part of their elementary education. A lawsuit that went all the way to the Supreme Court, ended the practice that year. Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible, using a razor to cut out the'supernatural'parts, such as the miracles and the resurrection. Today, new members of Congress receive a copy upon election. the forbidden fruit in the Bible was not an apple. It only became known as an apple when the bible was translated into Latin in the 4th century, because the word " Malus " means both apple and evil. the biblical Tower of Babel was likely based on a real building, the Etemenanki in modern - day Iraq ; at about 300 feet tall, it was massive by ancient standards and built by King Nebuchadnezzar II. Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams are the only two US Presidents that did not use a Bible at their swearing - in ceremonies.	completely agree, couldn't have said it better	yes. i thought it was a lot easier to get to. i thought it would have been easier to get to the top and watch the sun.

ctrl	tc	Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. Jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an AM radio. according to Canadian law, all radios are required to have at least 40 % of the music played be Canadian. soldiers in WWII made simple radios using a razorblade and pencil as the diode, dubbing them Foxhole Radios. there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free.

The beginning of fantasy football season has all owners full of hope, yet it can also be frustrating to decide on your lineup. After all, there is no recent track record on which to base this season's decisions. You can, however, focus more on matchups, a key ingredient in determining who to start or sit in the opening weeks, as well as performance in previous seasons. Quarterbacks facing teams without premier pass rushers are prized while those without the necessary skill players are risky propositions. And who wants to deal with added risk when bragging rights are on the line? [ Experts'mock draft analysis ] Luckily, you've found a shortcut : Here are three players to start and three to sit in your fantasy football league this week. Start Andy Dalton, QB, Cincinnati Bengals The Bengals'offensive line should have no trouble keeping Dalton clean in the pocket against the Indianapolis Colts, and the team also shouldn't have to worry about errant passes being intercepted.

" I do want to know why we're here, where we're going ; trying to find that deeper purpose. To live it, through sports in a very authentic way, makes so much sense to me. " [ In a tough sports town, baptisms and Bible studies fuel many of the Eagles'stars ] For Chopra, son of best - selling spiritual writer Deepak Chopra and a devoted Boston sports fan, seeing sports as a religion makes sense. Both create community, have saints and rituals, and take place on hallowed ground. And - in a polarized nation - both can unite disparate groups of people, at least for a few hours. Sports might bring people together better than religion, said Daniel Wann, a psychology professor at Murray State University in Kentucky. People who might never talk to one another in real life can bond at a sporting event. " It has the ability to integrate people from an incredibly diverse set of backgrounds, " Wann said. " I don't know any pastime that does that better than fandom. " The Patriots certainly have a devoted group of fans. They have their own creed : " In Bill We Trust, " a sign of their unshakable faith in Belichick, who has led his teams to more playoff victories than any other coach in NFL history. And Brady has been the chief apostle of the Patriot Way - the team's combination of intense preparation, relentless focus and ruthless determination to win, summed up by the phrase " Do your job. " Fans have bought in with near - religious devotion, said Chris Beneke, professor of history at Bentley University in Waltham, Mass.

ctrl	tc	Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. Radio systems need a transmitter to modulate ( change ) some property of the energy produced to impress a signal on it, for example using amplitude modulation or angle modulation ( which can be frequency modulation or phase modulation ). Radio systems also need an antenna to convert electric currents into radio waves, and radio waves into an electric current. The electrical resonance of tuned circuits in radios allow individual frequencies to be selected. The electromagnetic wave is intercepted by a tuned receiving antenna. A radio receiver receives its input from an antenna and converts it into a form that is usable for the consumer, such as sound, pictures, digital data, measurement values, navigational positions, etc. Jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an AM radio. according to Canadian law, all radios are required to have at least 40 % of the music played be Canadian. soldiers in WWII made simple radios using a razorblade and pencil as the diode, dubbing them Foxhole Radios. there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free.

t5	tc	The Bible ( from Koine Greek  , t√† bibla, " the books " ) is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures that Jews and Christians consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans. With estimated total sales of over 5 billion copies, it is widely considered to be the most influential and best - selling book of all time. Many different authors contributed to the Bible. What is regarded as canonical text differs depending on traditions and groups ; a number of Bible canons have evolved, with overlapping and diverging contents. The Christian Old Testament overlaps with the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint ; the Hebrew Bible is known in Judaism as the Tanakh. The New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians, believed to be mostly Jewish disciples of Christ, written in first - century Koine Greek. These early Christian Greek writings consist of Gospels, letters, and apocalyptic writings. Among Christian denominations there is some disagreement about what should be included in the canon, primarily about the Apocrypha, a list of works that are regarded with varying levels of respect. prior to 1963 it was not uncommon for students in the US to be required to read from The Bible as part of their elementary education. A lawsuit that went all the way to the Supreme Court, ended the practice that year. Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible, using a razor to cut out the'supernatural'parts, such as the miracles and the resurrection. Today, new members of Congress receive a copy upon election. the forbidden fruit in the Bible was not an apple. It only became known as an apple when the bible was translated into Latin in the 4th century, because the word " Malus " means both apple and evil. the biblical Tower of Babel was likely based on a real building, the Etemenanki in modern - day Iraq ; at about 300 feet tall, it was massive by ancient standards and built by King Nebuchadnezzar II. Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams are the only two US Presidents that did not use a Bible at their swearing - in ceremonies.	yeah he must have really not liked the miracles and the resurrection pat of it	i think he would have found that amazing. have you heard of thomas jefferson?

t5	tc	Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. Jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an AM radio. according to Canadian law, all radios are required to have at least 40 % of the music played be Canadian. soldiers in WWII made simple radios using a razorblade and pencil as the diode, dubbing them Foxhole Radios. there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free.

These different variations of football are known as football codes. There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played by indigenous peoples in many different parts of the world. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the nineteenth century. By the end of the nineteenth century, distinct regional codes were already developing : Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.

He is one of only two players in NFL history to have won five Super Bowls ( along with defensive player Charles Haley ) , and he is the only player to have won them all with a single franchise . Because of his numerous accomplishments and accolades , many analysts and sportswriters consider Brady to be among the greatest quarterbacks of all time . After playing college football for the University of Michigan , Brady was drafted by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft . Due to his late draft selection , Brady is considered to be the biggest " steal " in the history of the NFL Draft . In Brady 's sixteen seasons as a starter , he has quarterbacked the Patriots to eight Super Bowl appearances , the most for any player in history . Brady is also one of only two quarterbacks to win the Super Bowl in their first season as a starter , the other being Kurt Warner . Tom Brady 's wife , Gisele Bundchen , makes more than double her husband 's salary . Bill Belichick lists Tom Brady on the injury report every week , even though he shows no signs of injury Tom Brady had never thrown 30 touchdown passes in a season prior to 2007 . He threw a then - record 50 that year . Tom Brady has never eaten a strawberry in his entire life .

The functions exercised by a president vary according to the form of government. In parliamentary republics, they are limited to those of the head of state, and are thus largely ceremonial. In presidential and semi - presidential republics, the role of the president is more prominent, encompassing also ( in most cases ) the functions of the head of government. In authoritarian regimes, a dictator or leader of a one - party state may also be called a president. the top three wealthiest presidents in American history were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson. the first President of Zimbabwe was called President Banana. the U.S. President's Guest House is larger than the White House. until 1805 in the US, the runner up in a presidential election automatically became the vice president. the President of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office.	hi do you know much about the presidents?	yes, they are the head of state in most republics	Fully attributable

Bill Belichick is the winningest coach in NFL postseason football with 21 wins. 20 with the New England Patriots and 1 with the Cleveland Browns. Buffalo Bills are equal to the New England Patriots...

The Giants involuntarily scored a touchdown but won anyway. The Cleveland Browns'last playoff win was in 1995 against the New England Patriots and their head coach was Bill Belichick.

" He was roundly criticized for ignoring an ugly incident late in the 1978 Gator Bowl game, when Ohio State coach Woody Hayes punched Clemson player Charlie Baumann after Baumann had intercepted a pass near the Ohio State sideline. Recalling the scene for the Atlanta Journal - Constitution in 1999, Mr. Jackson said that because the sideline was crowded with players and officials, " the fact of the matter is, I didn't see [ the punch ].... If people go back and listen, I said,'Let's look at the tape and see what happened.'" Mr. Jackson rose above that incident, later winning an Emmy and being inducted into two sportscasting halls of fame. Besides his college football work, he called college and pro basketball games, Major League Baseball, auto racing and the Summer and Winter Olympics. In 1970, he was the first play - by - play announcer for the " Monday Night Football " NFL broadcast on ABC.

With estimated total sales of over 5 billion copies, it is widely considered to be the most influential and best - selling book of all time. Many different authors contributed to the Bible. What is regarded as canonical text differs depending on traditions and groups ; a number of Bible canons have evolved, with overlapping and diverging contents. The Christian Old Testament overlaps with the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint ; the Hebrew Bible is known in Judaism as the Tanakh. The New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians, believed to be mostly Jewish disciples of Christ, written in first - century Koine Greek. These early Christian Greek writings consist of Gospels, letters, and apocalyptic writings. Among Christian denominations there is some disagreement about what should be included in the canon, primarily about the Apocrypha, a list of works that are regarded with varying levels of respect. prior to 1963 it was not uncommon for students in the US to be required to read from The Bible as part of their elementary education. A lawsuit that went all the way to the Supreme Court, ended the practice that year.

" It would be hard to describe Belichick that way. He doesn't exude any of the qualities that we typically associate with charismatic figures. " Beneke worries that devotion to the Patriots can overshadow other kinds of faith. During the football season, Sundays in New England often are devoted to watching the Patriots and talking about the team, even in church, he said. [ The best of Super Bowl LII : Gronkowski good to go for Sunday ; Trump passes on traditional interview ] Some Patriots have tried to keep the focus on faith in God, rather than the team. The Patriots have a number of spiritual players, including Pro Bowl special teamer Matthew Slater, known for his off - field evangelism. Slater and other Patriots will be featured in Football Sunday, a national church - based outreach event on Super Bowl Sunday. Rick McDaniel, a Patriots fan and the pastor of Richmond Community Church in Glen Allen, Va., says there are faith lessons in Brady's example - even if you don't buy his TB12 Method. Brady's commitment to his craft allowed him to overcome the odds, McDaniel said. Brady began his career as a sixth - round draft pick and now is arguably the best ever at his craft. And he's shown the ability to rebound from adversity : Last year, the Patriots were down 28 to 3 in the Super Bowl before coming back to win in overtime. " He is a great example of what can happen if you are radically committed, " McDaniel said. McDaniel believes Brady's commitment to the TB12 Method is sincere.	i was never much a fan but after i saw his tom vs time documentary it totally changed my mind. i give him all the credit he deserves now and yes... i'm a fan now lol	i think he's got some big names that can really change the way people think about football. for example brady's commitment to the tb12 method allowed him to overcome the odds.

News of the Bengals'addition of Savage was met with a pointed reaction by Nessa Diab, a radio host who has been dating Colin Kaepernick for several years. Kaepernick has been unable to latch on with an NFL team since becoming a free agent in March 2017, and he has filed a grievance against the NFL, claiming that he is being deliberately and unfairly ostracized by team owners as punishment for his social activism and his status, in particular, as the originator of NFL player protests during the national anthem. Dalton has been the Bengals'starting quarterback since they made him a second - round draft pick out of TCU in 2011. An injury to his right thumb was also the cause of his only previous absence, when he missed the final three games of the 2015 regular season and a playoff appearance. That injury ended what had been by far Dalton&rsquo;s best individual campaign, as he posted career highs in passer rating ( 106.2 ) yards per attempt ( 8.4 ) and touchdown percentage ( 6.5 ). Through 11 games this season, he completed 61.9 percent of his passes for 21 touchdowns, 11 interceptions and an 89.6 rating.

Because of his numerous accomplishments and accolades, many analysts and sportswriters consider Brady to be among the greatest quarterbacks of all time. After playing college football for the University of Michigan, Brady was drafted by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft. Due to his late draft selection, Brady is considered to be the biggest " steal " in the history of the NFL Draft. In Brady's sixteen seasons as a starter, he has quarterbacked the Patriots to eight Super Bowl appearances, the most for any player in history. Brady is also one of only two quarterbacks to win the Super Bowl in their first season as a starter, the other being Kurt Warner. Tom Brady's wife, Gisele Bundchen, makes more than double her husband's salary. Bill Belichick lists Tom Brady on the injury report every week, even though he shows no signs of injury. Tom Brady had never thrown 30 touchdown passes in a season prior to 2007. He threw a then - record 50 that year.

If he could do that as a rookie , before tearing a knee ligament , imagine what he could do in a full season , right ?

The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated , which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct . The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors , sensory capabilities , and physical attributes . Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch - rich diet that would be inadequate for other canid species . Dogs vary widely in shape , size and colors . Dogs perform many roles for humans , such as hunting , herding , pulling loads , protection , assisting police and military , companionship and , more recently , aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles .

t5	tc	The president is a common title for the head of state in most republics. In politics, president is a title given to leaders of republican states. The functions exercised by a president vary according to the form of government. In parliamentary republics, they are limited to those of the head of state, and are thus largely ceremonial. In presidential and semi - presidential republics, the role of the president is more prominent, encompassing also ( in most cases ) the functions of the head of government. In authoritarian regimes, a dictator or leader of a one - party state may also be called a president. the top three wealthiest presidents in American history were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson. the first President of Zimbabwe was called President Banana. the U.S. President's Guest House is larger than the White House. until 1805 in the US, the runner up in a presidential election automatically became the vice president. the President of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office.	yes i agree. i would like to know more about that. up until 1805 the runner up automatically became the vice president. kind of makes sense but it would never work now!	that is very ironic. maybe the president in indonesia had a pop record while in office.

ctrl	tc	Thomas Edward Patrick Brady Jr. ( born August 3, 1977 ) is an American football quarterback for the New England Patriots of the National Football League ( NFL ). He is one of only two players in NFL history to have won five Super Bowls ( along with defensive player Charles Haley ), and he is the only player to have won them all with a single franchise. Because of his numerous accomplishments and accolades, many analysts and sportswriters consider Brady to be among the greatest quarterbacks of all time. After playing college football for the University of Michigan, Brady was drafted by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft. Due to his late draft selection, Brady is considered to be the biggest " steal " in the history of the NFL Draft. In Brady's sixteen seasons as a starter, he has quarterbacked the Patriots to eight Super Bowl appearances, the most for any player in history. Brady is also one of only two quarterbacks to win the Super Bowl in their first season as a starter, the other being Kurt Warner. Tom Brady's wife, Gisele Bundchen, makes more than double her husband's salary. Bill Belichick lists Tom Brady on the injury report every week, even though he shows no signs of injury. Tom Brady had never thrown 30 touchdown passes in a season prior to 2007. He threw a then - record 50 that year.

ctrl	tc	The Bible ( from Koine Greek  , t√† bibla, " the books " ) is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures that Jews and Christians consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans. With estimated total sales of over 5 billion copies, it is widely considered to be the most influential and best - selling book of all time. Many different authors contributed to the Bible. What is regarded as canonical text differs depending on traditions and groups ; a number of Bible canons have evolved, with overlapping and diverging contents. The Christian Old Testament overlaps with the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint ; the Hebrew Bible is known in Judaism as the Tanakh. The New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians, believed to be mostly Jewish disciples of Christ, written in first - century Koine Greek. These early Christian Greek writings consist of Gospels, letters, and apocalyptic writings. Among Christian denominations there is some disagreement about what should be included in the canon, primarily about the Apocrypha, a list of works that are regarded with varying levels of respect. prior to 1963 it was not uncommon for students in the US to be required to read from The Bible as part of their elementary education. A lawsuit that went all the way to the Supreme Court, ended the practice that year. Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible, using a razor to cut out the'supernatural'parts, such as the miracles and the resurrection. Today, new members of Congress receive a copy upon election. the forbidden fruit in the Bible was not an apple.

t5	tc	Nick Saban spoke briefly with Louisville Coach Bobby Petrino ( left ). ( John Raoux / Associated Press ) Okay, Nick Saban, we get it. You really, really hate those brief postgame television interviews, and find the questions you are asked about your quarterbacks to be far, far beneath you. We got it weeks ago, with the exasperated sighs and snarky responses that come whenever you face reporters'questions. Honestly, we have some sympathy. Journalists don't think like coaches and vice versa, which means that interview sessions can become nothing more than condescending cliches offered in response to softball inquiries. But sometimes, as when there's an obvious quarterback controversy of your own making, the questions are legit, no matter how tiring they may be. The latest example of the Alabama coach's disdain for transparency about his quarterbacks came after the Crimson Tide's 51 - 14 victory over Louisville in Saturday night's season opener, when an abrasive reply to an ESPN reporter reportedly prompted Saban to call her and apologize. ESPN's Maria Taylor asked Saban after the game what answers he had gotten about quarterbacks Tua Tagovailoa and Jalen Hurts during their first outing of the season. As postgame on - field questions go, this one was on point ; Alabama's quarterback position has been a subject of debate since Saban benched Hurts in the national championship game and Tagovailoa led the team to an overtime victory over Georgia. [ College football's first weekend offered an introductory course on delirium and euphoria ] Tagovailoa got the start against Louisville on Saturday night and completed 12 of 16 passes for 227 yards and two touchdowns ; he rushed for 26 yards on five carries and scored, too.	do you think what nick saban did to the espn reporter was ok?	not sure. do you think he did?

ctrl	tc	Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. Jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an AM radio. according to Canadian law, all radios are required to have at least 40 % of the music played be Canadian. soldiers in WWII made simple radios using a razorblade and pencil as the diode, dubbing them Foxhole Radios. there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free.

t5	tc	Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. Jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an AM radio. according to Canadian law, all radios are required to have at least 40 % of the music played be Canadian. soldiers in WWII made simple radios using a razorblade and pencil as the diode, dubbing them Foxhole Radios. there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free. That since 1989 a Finnish radio station has broadcast'Nuntii Latini'- a weekly news programme conducted entirely in Classical Latin.	i could nt even figure that one out now. that was pretty genius of them.	no, but it is very effective! it was nice chatting with you today!
